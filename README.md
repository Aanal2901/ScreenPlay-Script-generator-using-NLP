# ScreenPlay Script generator using NLP

### This project is divided in three parts.
##### All the models were trained on Kaggle notebook, setting accelerator in GPU. 
##### Language used is Python.
##### Libraries - Transformers, torch, numpy, matplotlib
The first model is Pretrained GPT2 model imported using Transformer libraries. This is available [here](https://github.com/Aanal2901/ScreenPlay-Script-generator-using-NLP/blob/main/gtp2_pretrained_model.py).   
The second model is made from scratch by training only on the scripts from all.txt file.   
The third model is made by fine-tuning the GPT2 model using scripts from all.txt.
