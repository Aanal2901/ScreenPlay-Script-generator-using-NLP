# ScreenPlay Script generator using NLP

### This project is divided in three parts.
##### All the models were trained on Kaggle notebook, setting accelerator in GPU. 
##### Language used is Python.
##### Libraries - Transformers, torch, numpy, matplotlib
The [first model](https://github.com/Aanal2901/ScreenPlay-Script-generator-using-NLP/blob/main/gtp2_pretrained_model.py) is Pretrained GPT2 model imported using Transformer libraries.    
The [second model](https://github.com/Aanal2901/ScreenPlay-Script-generator-using-NLP/blob/main/gpt2_fine_tune.py) is made from scratch by training only on the scripts from all.txt file.   
The [third model](https://github.com/Aanal2901/ScreenPlay-Script-generator-using-NLP/blob/main/gpt2_fine_tune.py) is made by fine-tuning the GPT2 model using scripts from all.txt.

Well because it was an out of state bank. Anyway, I was working as a busboy in a hotel, and she was sitting, drinking her coffee, and she was so beautiful, and I say hi to her. Thatâ€™s how we met.

So, I mean, what's the interesting part?

Well the interesting part is that

that you really don't know her at all. I think I had seen her a couple times, and the first one I heard from her was. I heard that from a pretty old friend, she was the one who was like that with us. We were driving on the highway down there. My friend was driving over there with his girlfriend, and she got into a little bit of a mess, and it was kind of a hot-and-straw kind of place. Like she was saying something about a really big truck. She was like, "Oh my God." And her friend stopped him. "You're all so hot!" It was like, "What? You wanna go over there with me?" So at that point, what kind of reaction were people gonna get?

MARK
Oh my god, man. There were people driving. I think they were looking up, you know what we mean? A couple of people got over there.
So those folks were driving over the highway. They're over'
